## Face Recognition using Deep Learning
    Collected the dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwingupta3012/human-faces
    Tained the model by using CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) and VGG16
    Face_detection_model.ipynb is used to train the model on the dataset

## Getting Started
## Dependencies
    Google colab (Used to train the model)
    Spyder

## Python Libraries
    Os
    Tensorflow
    Keras
    ImageDataGenerator
    Rmsprop
    VGG16
    Layers
    Cv2
    Image
    BytesIO
    Numpy
    load_model

## Executing program
    There are 6 phases of this program, run each of them.
    Extract embeddings from face dataset
    Train face recognition model
    Load the
    Recognize faces with OpenCV
    Recognize faces in video streams
    Detect the face
